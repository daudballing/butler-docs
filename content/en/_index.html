	Butler exposes a REST API endpoint for starting reload tasks.  
	This makes it easy to start reloads from within the load script of Sense apps, 
	or from any external system.  

	A great use case is to have a source system kick off Sense reloads once 
	new data is available in the source system, minimizing delays.

Tired of end users asking "when is the new data available?"

	Use Butler to send Slack messages to end users and stakeholders when
	apps have reloaded with fresh data.

	Sending a Slack message is as simple as calling a single function in
	the Sense load script.

Would you like to get an email when reload tasks fail?

	Use the templates included with Butler to hook into the Sense logging framework.
	You can get task failure notifications as emails, MQTT messages, or
	just plain UDP messages.

Are you a fan of machine-to-machine communication?

	Great, have your source system publish an MQTT message to the `sense/starttask` topic. 
	Butler will pick it up - and guess what - start the task.


And more. Butler is somewhat like a Swiss army knife - it gets the job done...
