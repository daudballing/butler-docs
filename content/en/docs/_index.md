### What's new in version 3.0

* **Enable only the REST API endpoints you need.** No more, no less.  
  This might seem like a minor change, but is actually conceptually important from a security perspective.
  Each and every endpoint is a possible attack vector into a system, and in the spirit of security you may thus want to only expose the endpoints you actually need and use.
* **Improved logging** throughout the app makes it easier to debug and solve for example configuration issues.
