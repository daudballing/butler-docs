  How to install Butler.
---

{{% pageinfo %}}
Given the cross platform nature of Node.js (which is the language Butler is written in), Butler can run lots of different hardware platforms and operating depends.  

It is therefore difficult to give detailed installation instructions for each possible installation scenario. This site thus tries explain how to get started with Butler in some of the most common scenarios.

## Getting started

Sorry - there is no installer for Butler.  
You will need to work a bit on the command line to set things up.  

It's not as bad as it sounds though, the instructions here should help settings things up.

## Prerequisites

Either you install a few pieces of software (most notably [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and some node modules), or you run Butler in a Docker container.  

Either way you also need to edit the configuration file and provide certificates exported from Qlik Sense Enterprise.


## Installation

Where can your user find your project code? How can they install it (binaries, installable package, build from source)? Are there multiple options/versions they can install and how should they choose the right one for them?

Follow the [installation and configuration instructions](/docs/getting-started/install) - they will guide through the setup process, including requirements and customisation.

## Setup

Is there any initial setup users need to do after installation to try your project?


## Try it out!

Can your users test their installation, for example by running a commmand or deploying a Hello World example?

Then browse through [the examples](/docs/examples) to get an understanding of how to use Butler.
