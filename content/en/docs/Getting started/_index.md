## Getting started

Sorry - there is no installer for Butler.  
You will need to work a bit on the command line to set things up.  

It's not as bad as it sounds though, the instructions here should help settings things up.

## Prerequisites

Either you install a few pieces of software (most notably [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and some node modules), or you run Butler in a Docker container (all dependencies are included in the Docker image).  

Either way you also need to edit the configuration file and provide certificates exported from Qlik Sense Enterprise.


## Installation

Follow the [installation instructions](./install) - they will guide through the setup process, including requirements and customisation.


## Setup

Once everything is installed you need to [edit the configuration file](./setup) to suit your specific needs.

## Try it out!

Feel free to browse through [the examples](sample-code.md) to get an understanding of how Butler can be used.
