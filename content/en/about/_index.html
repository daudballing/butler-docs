Butler was born out of a need to solve a set of specific challenges around using Qlik Sense together with other software tools.

Initially it offered a REST API for sending [Slack](https://slack.com) messages from the Sense load script, 
but over the years more have been added and Butler today offers a rather diverse set of features. 

Some features are offered via a REST API (trigger app reloads, send Slack messages, send MQTT pubsub messages etc), 
while others hook into the Sense logging framework to get notifications when tasks fail, users log on/off or any 
other log events occur. 

The logging framework integration is pretty interesting: It makes it easier to get notifications from Sense *as they happen*, 
rather than minutes or hours later (as might be the case when relying on polling APIs or reloading the Operations Monitor app).
